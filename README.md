Analyze stock data for Steve 
Analysis of Green Stocks for 2017 and 2018

•	Overview of Project
o	Execute an analysis for green energy stocks from ’17 and ’18, to review and analyze their annual return and total volume.  I used VBA to include conditional formatting, For loops, conditional statements and code refactoring to see if there were improved efficiencies that could be found.  The purpose of the analysis was to help Steve with the analysis for his parents.  Steve is a newer graduate starting a job in the financial industry and he is looking to support his parents with financial advice.

The tables above illustrate the performance of 12 stocks from companies that use alternative energy.  The data contains ticker name, total daily volume for each year, and % of yearly return.  Green energy stocks in ’17 overall had a solid, positive year (high positive ratio) and only one negative result.  The ’18 data reflects a different story as most of the stocks show a negative return.  Specifically, the DQ stock reflects about a 200% gain in ’17 and a loss of 63% in ’18.  
•	Summary
o	The advantages and reason why we refactor code is to improve the code (for efficiency, make it easier to understand, and fix bugs that may exist in the original code.)  The disadvantages of refactoring code - it’s a time drain as it can be a bit overwhelming trying to determine what was meant to happen with the original coding.  That said, making comments as code is being written will make it easier to interpret what was intended in the original coding.  
o	It was frustrating to work with refactoring code from the original; especially for me being newer to the process.  It was not easy as the code can be very complex (& it may not need to be).  The upside was the feeling of satisfaction when I figured out an issue.
